# Object-declarations-Blocks-in-a-box
Let's create a simple class with a nested object. There is a box of blocks for kids. All of them are the same size but their colors can be different. We will store these objects in a class Block with one property color and a nested object BlockProperties with properties length and width. Your task is to create this structure!

In addition, your nested object should have a blocksInBox() function that receives the length and width (parameters order is important) of a box and returns the amount of blocks this box can store.

Make the properties of a nested object mutable for the validation system! You may initialize them with any numbers, for example, 6 and 4. as in the example. Don't worry about heights, solve it like a 2D problem. Don't rotate the blocks.
